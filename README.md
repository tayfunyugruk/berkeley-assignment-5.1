# Assignment 5.1

## Deliverable
Your final product should be a brief report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.  To explore the data you will utilize your knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python. You will publish your findings in a public facing github repository as your first portfolio piece.

## Main Investigation Report
1. Drivers who frequent bar goers (more than once a month) are the most likely demographic to accept bar coupons.
2. This behavior is consistent across age groups (both >25 and <30)
3. Presence of children reduces likelihood, while social passengers (friends/partners) likely increase it.
4. Low income habits (Less than 50K and going cheap restaurants) decreases the likelihood

## Independent Investigation Report
1. Frequency: People who visit coffee houses at least once a month have a much higher acceptance rate (~65%) compared to those who never go (~17%).
2. Passenger: Driving with friends or partners increases the likelihood of acceptance compared to driving alone.
3. Time: Coupons offered in the morning (10AM) are most effective, with acceptance rates dropping in the evening.
